## About Me

I am a First Class Computer Science graduate from the University of Wolverhampton, focused on building secure, scalable, cloud-ready software systems.

My core interest lies in backend engineering, distributed systems, cloud infrastructure, and production-grade application architecture. I design systems with security, maintainability, and scalability in mind.

I am actively strengthening Data Structures & Algorithms, system design, and DevOps engineering to operate at high-performance engineering standards.
